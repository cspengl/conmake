# Docker Agent

The docker agent uses the docker daemon to provision stations as docker images and execute steps on docker containers.

### Requirements

To use this agent you have to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine. An installation guide can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

### Configuration

The docker agent does not require any configuration. It automatically uses the local docker engine.
