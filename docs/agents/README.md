#### Agents

Conmake is designed to work with different '**Agents**'. A agent offers the basic functions to operate with stations (Initialize, Delete, etc.) and to perform steps on these stations.

> Currently there is just the 'docker agent' implemented which talks to the docker daemon to provision the stations as docker images. This gives you additionally the possibility to work with the stations via the docker-cli.

**Supported agents**

  - [Docker](docker.md)
